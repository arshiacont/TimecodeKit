# Getting Started

Documentation and guides to get the most out of TimecodeKit.

Add the library to your app project or Swift package, and import it.

```swift
import TimecodeKit
```

The library provides UI components that may also be imported if desired.

```swift
import TimecodeKitUI
```

The documentation page for ``Timecode`` is a good starting point to jump in. It provides a quick overview of how to form timecode and convert to/from various other time values.

The topics list in the sidebar give overviews of specific areas of concern.

If upgrading from TimecodeKit 1.x, see <doc:TimecodeKit-2-Migration-Guide>.
